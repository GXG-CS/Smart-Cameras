# Abstracting Hardware Capabilities using Raspberry Pi 4 Model B(Version 2)

Our objective is to create an abstraction metric to classify and understand the capabilities of various smart cameras. We will utilize the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B as a stand-in for these cameras by constraining ML process resources and observing the resulting behaviors.

## Metrics for Hardware Abstraction

- **S<sub>read</sub>**: Storage read speed (MB/s)
- **S<sub>cap</sub>**: Storage capacity (GB)
- **R<sub>cap</sub>**: RAM capacity (GB)
- **R<sub>speed</sub>**: RAM speed (MHz or GHz)
- **P<sub>speed</sub>**: CPU processing speed (GHz)
- **P<sub>cores</sub>**: Number of CPU cores
- **P<sub>consumption</sub>**: Power consumption (W)
- **T<sub>manage</sub>**: Thermal management capacity (째C)

## Steps:

1. **Resource Limitation for Simulation**:
    - Use tools like `cgroups` to limit the resources available to ML processes running on the Raspberry Pi. This mimics the resource constraints of various smart cameras.
    - Ensure all data is stored locally and focus on local training.

2. **Metrics Collection**:
    - After each training session under specific constraints, collect performance metrics. This includes things like training time, accuracy, model prediction speed, etc.

3. **Clustering Based on Metrics**:
    - Using the collected metrics, apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN) to classify the simulated hardware capabilities.
    
4. **Training the Metric Abstraction Model**:
    - Based on the clusters found, train a predictive model (potentially a simple regression or decision tree model) that can predict the cluster (representing a type of hardware capability) given a set of metrics.

5. **Validation & Testing**:
    - Once the model is trained, validate its predictions using a separate test set. This could involve creating new resource constraints, running the ML processes, collecting metrics, and then seeing if the model accurately predicts the hardware capability cluster.

By the end of this process, we should have a predictive model that, given certain performance metrics, can abstract and predict the hardware capabilities of a smart camera. This model would be particularly valuable for ML developers aiming to deploy models on varying hardware and wanting a quick understanding of what kind of performance they might expect.

## Abstracting Hardware Capabilities Using ML(Version 3)

### Objective:

Use machine learning clustering methods to classify various devices with different hardware capabilities. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B will be used to simulate various devices by limiting the resources of ML processes. Our goal is to abstract the capabilities of these simulated devices using a hardware capabilities metric and an ML performance metric.

### 1. Hardware Capabilities Metrics:

These metrics detail the properties of the simulated device:

- **Storage**: 
  - S<sub>read</sub>: Storage read speed (MB/s)
  - S<sub>cap</sub>: Storage capacity (GB)

- **RAM**: 
  - R<sub>cap</sub>: RAM capacity (GB)
  - R<sub>speed</sub>: RAM speed (MHz or GHz)

- **Processing**:
  - P<sub>speed</sub>: CPU processing speed (GHz)
  - P<sub>cores</sub>: Number of CPU cores

- **Power and Temperature**:
  - P<sub>consumption</sub>: Power consumption (W)
  - T<sub>manage</sub>: Thermal management capacity (째C)

### 2. ML Performance Metrics:

These metrics detail the performance of a machine learning model under the constraints of the associated hardware capabilities metrics:

- Training Time: Time taken to train the model (s)
- Accuracy: Model accuracy on a validation set (%)
- Inference Speed: Time taken for a single forward pass (ms)

### Data Structure:

Our dataset will essentially look like this:

| S<sub>read</sub> | S<sub>cap</sub> | R<sub>cap</sub> | ... | Training Time | Accuracy | Inference Speed |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| 50 MB/s          | 32 GB           | 4 GB            | ... | 200s          | 90%      | 5 ms            |
| 20 MB/s          | 16 GB           | 2 GB            | ... | 500s          | 85%      | 10 ms           |
| ...              | ...             | ...             | ... | ...           | ...      | ...             |

### Clustering Approach:

With the collected dataset, we'll use clustering algorithms like KMeans or DBSCAN to find patterns in our multi-dimensional data. The clusters formed will represent devices with similar hardware capabilities.

For each cluster formed, you'll have a group of simulated devices that perform similarly given their hardware constraints. This clustering will allow for easy categorization of new simulated devices to understand which cluster (and thus which kind of device capability) they most closely align with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hardware Capabilities Metrics (X):

Let `x1`, `x2`, ... `x8` represent the hardware capabilities metrics:

1. `x1`: S<sub>read</sub> - Storage read speed (MB/s)
2. `x2`: S<sub>cap</sub> - Storage capacity (GB)
3. `x3`: R<sub>cap</sub> - RAM capacity (GB)
4. `x4`: R<sub>speed</sub> - RAM speed (MHz or GHz)
5. `x5`: P<sub>speed</sub> - CPU processing speed (GHz)
6. `x6`: P<sub>cores</sub> - Number of CPU cores
7. `x7`: P<sub>consumption</sub> - Power consumption (W)
8. `x8`: T<sub>manage</sub> - Thermal management capacity (째C)

A single hardware setup or a simulated state can be represented as a vector:

\[ X = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8) \]
